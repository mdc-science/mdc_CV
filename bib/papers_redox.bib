	abstract = {The upregulation of endogenous antioxidants is a widespread phenomenon in animals that tolerate hypoxia/anoxia for extended periods. The identity of the mobilized antioxidant is often context-dependent and differs among species, tissues, and stresses. Thus, the contribution of individual antioxidants to the adaptation to oxygen deprivation remains elusive. This study investigated the role of glutathione ({GSH}) in the control of redox homeostasis under the stress of anoxia and reoxygenation in Helix aspersa, an animal model of anoxia tolerance. To do so, the total {GSH} ({tGSH}) pool was depleted with l-buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine ({BSO}) before exposing snails to anoxia for 6 h. Then, the concentration of {GSH}, glutathione disulfide ({GSSG}), and oxidative stress markers ({TBARS} and protein carbonyl) and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, glutathione reductase, and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) were measured in foot muscle and hepatopancreas. {BSO} alone induced {tGSH} depletion by 59–75\%, but no other changes happened in other variables, except for foot {GSSG}. Anoxia elicited a 110–114\% increase in glutathione peroxidase in the foot; no other changes occurred during anoxia. However, {GSH} depletion before anoxia increased the {GSSG}/{tGSH} ratio by 84–90\% in both tissues, which returned to baseline levels during reoxygenation. Our findings indicate that glutathione is required to withstand the oxidative challenge induced by hypoxia and reoxygenation in land snails.},

	abstract = {Preparation for oxidative stress ({POS}) is a widespread adaptive response to harsh environmental conditions, whose hallmark is the upregulation of antioxidants. In contrast to controlled laboratory settings, animals are exposed to multiple abiotic stressors under natural field conditions. Still, the interplay between different environmental factors in modulating redox metabolism in natural settings remains largely unexplored. Here, we aim to shed light on this topic by assessing changes in redox metabolism in the mussel
              Brachidontes solisianus
              naturally exposed to a tidal cycle. We compared the redox biochemical response of mussels under six different natural conditions in the field along two consecutive days. These conditions differ in terms of chronology, immersion/emersion, and solar radiation, but not in terms of temperature. Animals were collected after being exposed to air early morning (7:30), immersed during late morning and afternoon (8:45–15:30), and then exposed to air again late afternoon towards evening (17:45–21:25), in two days. Whole body homogenates were used to measure the activity of antioxidant (catalase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase) and metabolic (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase) enzymes, reduced ({GSH}) and disulfide ({GSSG}) glutathione levels, and oxidative stress markers (protein carbonyl and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances). Air and water temperature remained stable between 22.5 °C and 26 °C during both days. Global solar radiation ({GSR}) greatly differed between days, with a cumulative {GSR} of 15,381 {kJ}/m
              2
              for day 1 and 5,489 {kJ}/m
              2
              for day 2, whose peaks were 2,240 {kJ}/m
              2
              /h at 14:00 on day 1 and 952 {kJ}/m
              2
              /h at 12:00 on day 2. Compared with animals underwater, emersion during early morning did not elicit any alteration in redox biomarkers in both days. Air exposure for 4 h in the late afternoon towards evening caused oxidative damage to proteins and lipids and elicited {GSH} synthesis in animals that had been previously exposed to high {GSR} during the day. In the following day, when {GSR} was much lower, exposure to air under the same conditions (duration, time, and temperature) had no effect on any redox biomarker. These findings suggest that air exposure under low-intensity solar radiation is not sufficient to trigger {POS} in
              B. solisianus
              in its natural habitat. Thus, natural {UV} radiation is possibly a key environmental factor that combined to air exposure induces the {POS}-response to the stressful event of tidal variation in this coastal species.},

	abstract = {The upregulation of endogenous antioxidants (i.e., preparation for oxidative stress, {POS}) is part of the biochemical responses underlying the adaptation of animals to adverse environments. Despite the phylogenetic diversity of animals in which {POS} has been described, most studies focus on animals under controlled laboratory conditions. To address this limitation, we have recently assessed the redox metabolism in the skeletal muscle of
              Proceratophrys cristiceps
              estivating under natural settings in the Caatinga. Here, we analyzed biochemical biomarkers in the muscle of another Caatinga species,
              Pleurodema diplolister
              , during the rainy (active) and dry (estivating frogs) seasons. We aimed to determine whether
              P. diplolister
              enhances its antioxidants during estivation under field conditions and to identify any effect of species on the biochemical responses of
              P. diplolister
              and
              P. cristiceps
              associated with estivation. To do so, we measured the activities of representative enzymes of intermediary metabolism and antioxidant systems, as well as glutathione and protein carbonyl levels, in the skeletal muscle of
              P. diplolister
              . Our findings revealed the suppression of oxidative metabolism and activation of antioxidant enzymes in estivating
              P. diplolister
              compared with active specimens. No changes in oxidative damage to proteins were observed and estivating
              P. diplolister
              had lower levels of disulfide glutathione ({GSSG}) and disulfide-to-total glutathione ratio ({GSSG}/{tGSH}) than those observed in active individuals. When data for
              P. diplolister
              and
              P. cristiceps
              were assembled and analyzed, significant effects of species were detected on the activities of metabolic enzymes (citrate synthase, isocitric dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, and creatine kinase) and antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase), as well as on {GSSG}/{tGSH} ratio. Such effects might underlie the physiological and behavioral differences between these two species that share the same microhabitat and survival strategy (i.e., to estivate) during the dry season. Despite some peculiarities, which reflect the physiological diversity of the mechanisms associated with estivation in the Brazilian Caatinga, both
              P. diplolister
              and
              P. cristiceps
              seem to balance the suppression of oxidative pathways, the maintenance of the capacity of oxygen-independent pathways, and the activation of endogenous antioxidants to preserve muscle function and be ready to resume activity whenever the unpredictable rainy period arrives.},

              Juvenile tegu lizards (
              Salvator merianae
              ) experience gradual and mild temperature changes from autumn to winter in their habitat. This tropical/subtropical reptile enter a state of dormancy, with an 80\% reduction in metabolic rate, that remains almost constant during winter. The redox metabolism in non-mammalian vertebrates that hibernate under such distinguished conditions is poorly understood. We analyzed the redox metabolism in the intestine of juvenile tegus during different stages of their first annual cycle. The effect of food deprivation (in spring) was also studied to compare with fasting during hibernation. Both winter dormancy and food deprivation caused decreases in reduced glutathione levels and glutathione transferase activity. While glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase activities decreased during winter dormancy, as well as glutathione ({GSH}) levels, other antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase) remained unchanged. Notably, levels of disulfide glutathione ({GSSG}) were 2.1-fold higher in late autumn, when animals were in the process of depressing metabolism towards hibernation. This increased “oxidative tonus” could be due to a disruption in {NADPH}-dependent antioxidant systems. In dormancy, {GSSG} and lipid hydroperoxides were diminished by 60–70\%. The results suggest that the entrance into hibernation is the main challenge for the redox homeostasis in the intestine of juvenile tegus.},
