              Background
              Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems ({SEDDSs}) have attracted attention because of their effects on solubility and bioavailability of lipophilic compounds. Herein, a {SEDDS} loaded with lycopene purified from red guava ({nanoLPG}) was produced. The nanoemulsion was characterized using dynamic light scattering ({DLS}), zeta potential measurement, nanoparticle tracking analysis ({NTA}), transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ({FTIR}), lycopene content quantification, radical scavenging activity and colloidal stability in cell culture medium. Then, in vivo toxicity and tissue distribution in orally treated mice and cytotoxicity on human prostate carcinoma cells ({DU}-145) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMC}) were evaluated.
            
            
              Results
              {NanoLPG} exhibited physicochemical properties with a size around 200 nm, negative zeta-potential, and spherical morphology. The size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential parameters suffered insignificant alterations during the 12 month storage at 5 °C, which were associated with lycopene stability at 5 °C for 10 months. The nanoemulsion showed partial aggregation in cell culture medium at 37 °C after 24 h. {NanoLPG} at 0.10 mg/{mL} exhibited radical scavenging activity equivalent to 0.043 ± 0.002 mg Trolox/{mL}. The in vivo studies did not reveal any significant changes in clinical, behavioral, hematological, biochemical, and histopathological parameters in mice orally treated with {nanoLPG} at 10 mg/kg for 28 days. In addition, {nanoLPG} successfully delivered lycopene to the liver, kidney and prostate in mice, improved its cytotoxicity against {DU}-145 prostate cancer cells—probably by pathway independent on classical necrosis and apoptosis—and did not affect {PBMC} viability.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Thus, {nanoLPG} stands as a promising and biosafe lycopene delivery system for further development of nanotechnology-based health products.

	abstract = {Amphibian secretions have been extensively investigated for the production of bioactive molecules. Salamandrin-I is an antioxidant peptide, isolated from the skin secretion of the fire salamander, that has induced no toxicity in microglia or erythrocytes. Importantly, the administration of antioxidants may constitute an adequate therapeutic approach to cancer treatment. Here, with the purpose of better characterizing the therapeutic potential of salamandrin-I, we investigated whether this antioxidant peptide also exerts anticancer activity, using the human leukemia cell line {HL}-60 as a cancer model. Salamandrin-I treatment induced a significant reduction in {HL}-60 proliferation, which was accompanied by cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the peptide-induced cell death showed a significant increase in the {LDH} release in {HL}-60 cells. The cellular toxicity exerted by salamandrin-I is possibly related to pyroptosis, since the {HL}-60 cells showed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and hyperexpression of inflammasome components following the peptide treatment. This is the first demonstration of the anticancer potential of the salamandrin-I peptide. Such results are important, as they offer relevant insights into the field of cancer therapy and allow the design of future bioactive molecules using salamandrin-I as a template.},

	abstract = {Piplartine, also known as piperlongumine, is a natural and biologically active amide alkaloid found in various Piper species within the Piperaceae family. It possesses numerous beneficial properties that can be leveraged in the development of nanotechnological and pharmaceutical products. However, information on the effects of piplartine on mammalian embryonic development is scarce. This study aims to assess the general toxicity and teratogenic potential of piplartine during the embryonic development of mice. Pregnant mice received daily treatments of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg of piplartine via gavage from the sixth day of gestation (implantation) to the eighteenth. On the eighteenth day, the mice were euthanized, and whole organs, blood samples (for hematological and biochemical analyses), and bone marrow cells (for {DNA} fragmentation and cell cycle assays) were collected. The uterus was examined for implantation sites and embryo resorptions. Additionally, fetuses were collected to assess for fetal anomalies. Piplartine did not result in maternal or embryo-fetal toxicity, induce fetal anomalies, cause hematological and biochemical alterations, or lead to {DNA} fragmentation. The oral administration of piplartine is safe and does not exhibit toxicity or teratogenic effects in mice. This finding opens avenues for the development of piplartine-based biotechnological products for therapeutic interventions in disease treatment.},

The plant age is a parameter that can influence the chemical composition of the essential oil, as well as its pharmacological potential. For this purpose, essential oils from aerial parts of V. curassavica produced at different ages (4, 10, 14 and 18 months-age) were used. According to chromatograms obtained by {GC}-{MS}, the essential oils were mainly composed of α-pinene, trans-caryophyllene, α-santalene, alloaromadendrene and α-humulene. The chemical composition of V. curassavica essential oils varied qualitatively and quantitatively with the aging of the plants, and the essential oils from plants at 18 month-age appeared to be the most distinct from the others. The tested essential oil samples showed inhibitory activity against Candida albicans ({MIC} = 1000 µg/{mL}) but did not show antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria. The cytotoxic activity levels against the murine macrophages varied among the oils extracted from the plants at different ages; the {IC}50 values of the essential oils increased with age (171.90 µg/{mL} at 18 month-age). More studies should be carried out to assess whether age also affects the therapeutic effects of essential oils, resulting in the manufacture of plant-derived formulations that balance production costs, toxicity and therapeutic effects.},

F4 did not impact viability but was also cytotoxic after 24 h. Most treatments reduced proinflammatory cytokine production ({IL}-2, {IL}-6, {IL}-17, and/or {TNF}), especially harmaline and F5 at 2.5 µM and higher concentrations, tetrahydroharmine (9.3 µM and higher), and F5 (10.7 µM and higher).

              Tryptophyllins constitute a heterogeneous group of peptides that are one of the first classes of peptides identified from amphibian’s skin secretions. Here, we report the structural characterization and antioxidant properties of a novel tryptophyllin‐like peptide, named {PpT}‐2, isolated from the Iberian green frog

              was obtained by electrical stimulation and fractionated using {RP}‐{HPLC}. De novo peptide sequencing was conducted using {MALDI} {MS}/{MS}. The primary structure of {PpT}‐2 ({FPWLLS}‐{NH}
              2
              ) was confirmed by Edman degradation and subsequently investigated using
              in silico
              tools. {PpT}‐2 shared physicochemical properties with other well‐known antioxidants. To test {PpT}‐2 for antioxidant activity
              in vitro
              , the peptide was synthesized by solid phase and assessed in the chemical‐based {ABTS} and {DPPH} scavenging assays. Then, a flow cytometry experiment was conducted to assess {PpT}‐2 antioxidant activity in oxidatively challenged murine microglial cells. As predicted by the in silico analyses, {PpT}‐2 scavenged free radicals
              in vitro
              and suppressed the generation of reactive species in {PMA}‐stimulated {BV}‐2 microglia cells. We further explored possible bioactivities of {PpT}‐2 against prostate cancer cells and bacteria, against which the peptide exerted a moderate antiproliferative effect and negligible antimicrobial activity. The biocompatibility of {PpT}‐2 was evaluated in cytotoxicity assays and

	abstract = {In addition to the morphophysiological changes experienced by amphibians during metamorphosis, they must also deal with a different set of environmental constraints when they shift from the water to the land. We found that
              Pithecopus azureus
              secretes a single peptide ([M + H]+ = 658.38 Da) at the developmental stage that precedes the onset of terrestrial behaviour.
              De novo
              peptide and {cDNA} sequencing revealed that the peptide, named {PaT}-2, is expressed in tandem and is a member of the tryptophyllins family.
              In silico
              studies allowed us to identify the position of reactive sites and infer possible antioxidant mechanisms of the compounds. Cell-based assays confirmed the predicted antioxidant activity in mammalian microglia and neuroblast cells. The potential neuroprotective effect of {PaT}-2 was further corroborated in {FRET}-based live cell imaging assays, where the peptide prevented lipopolysaccharide-induced {ROS} production and glutamate release in human microglia. In summary, {PaT}-2 is the first peptide expressed during the ontogeny of
              P. azureus
              , right before the metamorphosing froglet leaves the aquatic environment to occupy terrestrial habitats. The antioxidant activity of {PaT}-2, predicted by
              in silico
              analyses and confirmed by cell-based assays, might be relevant for the protection of the skin of

	abstract = {Amphibian skin is a multifunctional organ that plays key roles in defense, breathing, and water balance. In this study, skin secretion samples of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) were separated using {RP}-{HPLC} and de novo sequenced using {MALDI}-{TOF} {MS}/{MS}. Next, we used an in silico platform to screen antioxidant molecules in the framework of density functional theory. One of the identified peptides, salamandrin-I, [M + H]+ = 1406.6 Da, was selected for solid-phase synthesis; it showed free radical scavenging activity against {DPPH} and {ABTS} radicals. Salamandrin-I did not show antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. In vitro assays using human microglia and red blood cells showed that salamandrin-I has no cytotoxicity up to the concentration of 100 µM. In addition, in vivo toxicity tests on Galleria mellonella larvae resulted in no mortality at 20 and 40 mg/kg. Antioxidant peptides derived from natural sources are increasingly attracting interest. Among several applications, these peptides, such as salamandrin-I, can be used as templates in the design of novel antioxidant molecules that may contribute to devising strategies for more effective control of neurological disease.},

	abstract = {Leishmania protozoans are the causal agents of neglected diseases that represent an important public health issue worldwide. The growing occurrence of drug-resistant strains of Leishmania and severe side effects of available treatments represent an important challenge for the leishmaniases treatment. We have previously reported the leishmanicidal activity of phylloseptin-1 ({PSN}-1), a peptide found in the skin secretion of Phyllomedusa azurea (=Pithecopus azureus), against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes. However, its impact on the amastigote form of L. amazonensis and its impact on infected macrophages are unknown. In this work, we evaluated the effects of {PSN}-1 on amastigotes of L. amazonensis inside macrophages infected in vitro. We assessed the production of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, as well as the levels of inflammatory and immunomodulatory markers ({TGF}-β, {TNF}-α and {IL}-12), in infected and non-infected macrophages treated with {PSN}-1. Treatment with {PSN}-1 decreased the number of infected cells and the number of ingested amastigotes per cell when compared with the untreated cells. At 32 µM (64 µg/{mL}), {PSN}-1 reduced hydrogen peroxide levels in both infected and uninfected macrophages, whereas it had little effect on {NO} production or {TGF}-β release. The effect of {PSN}-1 on {IL}-12 and {TNF}-α secretion depended on its concentration, but, in general, their levels tended to increase as {PSN}-1 concentration increased. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of action of {PSN}-1 and its interaction with the immune system aiming to develop pharmacological applications.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to characterize the antioxidant properties of Rama Forte persimmon, a tannin-rich fruit variety produced in Brazil. Extracts prepared with lyophilized pulps from fruits obtained in local markets were analyzed individually to evaluate the extent of antioxidant protection and investigate the antioxidant mechanism. Iron-mediated hydroxylation of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pirrolidine-N-oxide, determined by electron paramagnetic resonance ({EPR}), and oxidative degradation of 2-deoxyribose (2-{DR}) were inhibited by fruit extracts in a dose-dependent manner. There was a considerable individual variability in inhibition of 2-{DR} degradation by individual fruits. Higher protection of 2-{DR} degradation (by the extracts) was observed in Fe({III})-citrate/ascorbate in comparison with Fe({III})-{EDTA}/ascorbate system; however, antioxidant effectiveness of fruit extracts was not diminished by increasing {EDTA} concentration by 10-fold. Other competition experiments using the 2-{DR} assay (varying pre-incubation time and 2-{DR} concentration) indicated that protection comes mainly from free radical scavenging, rather that metal chelation antioxidant activity. Persimmon extracts prevented iron-mediated lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenates, which correlated significantly with the inhibition of 2-{DR} oxidation. Finally, sugar content of individual fruits correlated inversely with inhibition of 2-{DR} degradation, which could indicate that maturation decreases soluble antioxidant concentration or efficiency. In conclusion, lipid peroxidation, 2-{DR} and {EPR} experiments indicated that extracts from commercial fruits showed mainly radical-scavenger activity and relevant antioxidant activity.},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis, caused by helminth flatworms of the genus Schistosoma, is an infectious disease mainly associated with poverty that affects millions of people worldwide. Since treatment for this disease relies only on the use of praziquantel, there is an urgent need to identify new antischistosomal drugs. Piplartine is an amide alkaloid found in several Piper species (Piperaceae) that exhibits antischistosomal properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the structure–function relationship between piplartine and its five synthetic analogues (19A, 1G, 1M, 14B and 6B) against Schistosoma mansoni adult worms, as well as its cytotoxicity to mammalian cells using murine fibroblast ({NIH}-3T3) and {BALB}/{cN} macrophage (J774A.1) cell lines. In addition, density functional theory calculations and in silico analysis were used to predict physicochemical and toxicity parameters. Bioassays revealed that piplartine is active against S. mansoni at low concentrations (5–10 µM), but its analogues did not. In contrast, based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ({MTT}) and flow cytometry assays, piplartine exhibited toxicity in mammalian cells at 785 µM, while its analogues 19A and 6B did not reduce cell viability at the same concentrations. This study demonstrated that piplartine analogues showed less activity against S. mansoni but presented lower toxicity than piplartine.},
