"The Role of Catalase during Anoxia and Reoxygenation in Gastropods","undergrad_project","Welker, A.F.; Moreira, D.C.; Hermes-Lima, M.","University of Brasilia, Brazil","when",NA,NA,TRUE,"The importance of each individual antioxidant enzyme for the adaptation of hypoxic tolerant animals to cycles of anoxia and reoxygenation is not well understood. The aim of this work was to assess the role of catalase in land snails Helixaspersa during post-anoxic reoxygenation by the suppression of its activity with aminotriazole (ATZ) injection. Catalase activity in foot muscle fell 60% after ATZ administration. ATZ alone resulted in no alterations in the activity of antioxidant enzymes, GSH levels, and oxidative stress markers (OSM): TBARS, carbonyl protein and GSSG:GSH ratio. Anoxia induced a rise in foot Se-GPX activity in saline- and ATZ-injected animals (1.8-2.0 fold). This elevated Se-GPX activity rapidly returned to normal levels at the onset of reoxygenation, whereas this return to normal activity happened 60 min later in ATZ-injected animals. Reoxygenation caused no changes in OSM in foot of saline- or ATZ-injected snails. In hepatopancreas, most parameters remained unchanged in response to ATZ (which suppressed 69% of catalase activity), anoxia or reoxygenation. Anoxia caused a tendency for the increase in Se-GPX activity in both groups (p=0.06 for saline and p=0.10 for ATZ) and only punctual and small increases in carbonyl protein during reoxygenation in ATZ-injected animals. These data show that Helixaspersa present an efficient antioxidant system, since oxidative stress was not observed during reoxygenation – even in tissues with catalase suppression. This suggests that activation of Se-GPX activity during anoxia (a process unaffected by ATZ) played a key adaptive role in reoxygenation. The activation of Se-GPX is also encountered in other mollusks during hypoxia/anoxia exposure, which is associated with minor oxidative stress."

"Role of Glutathione during Anoxia and Reoxygenation Stress in Terrestrial Gastropods","undergrad_project","Ferreira-Cravo, M.; Sabino, M.A.C.T.; Moreira, D.C.; Hermes-Lima, M.","University of Brasilia, Brazil","when",NA,NA,TRUE,"Previous studies have shown that endogenous antioxidant defenses are relevant for the control of oxidative damage induced by anoxia-plus-reoxygenation stress in terrestrial gastropods (Welker, 2009). One of these defense mechanisms include GSH metabolism. Thus, we decided to investigate oxidative stress in Helix aspersa snails during anoxia-plus-reoxygenation after GSH depletion by means of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) injection – an inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis. Total-GSH (GSH-eq) levels in digestive glands were reduced by 61% in BSO-injected animals. GSSG levels increased by 2-fold in BSO-injected snails during anoxia relative to normoxic snails. GSSG levels were sustained in BSO-injected snails during reoxygenation (15 min to 2 h) despite the partial depletion in GSH-eq. GSSG:GSH-eq ratio also increased (by 2-fold) in anoxia and 15 min-reoxygenation in BSO-injected animals, indicative of a more oxidized state. TBARS and carbonylated proteins were unchanged. Small changes were observed in the activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, GST, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase) during anoxia plus reoxygenation in saline- and BSO-injected snails. These activity changes might be related to readjustments of redox metabolism under anoxia/reoxygenation. Thus, partial loss of GSH induces a condition of mild oxidative stress during the phases of oxygen depletion (prior to full anoxia) and reoxygenation. This indicates a relevant role for GSH in the gastropod resistance to anoxia-plus-reoxygenation stress."

"Antioxidant Modulation in Response to Blood-feeding in Vampire Bats","undergrad_project","Andrade Jr., R.; Oliveira, P.L.; Moreira, D.C.; Hermes-Lima, M.","University of Brasilia, Brazil","when",NA,NA,TRUE,"Unique among mammals, the common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus is an obligatory blood feeder and, therefore must handle daily large quantities of ingested hemoglobin-iron. Previous data from our lab indicated that despite its potentially oxidative diet, the vampire bat presents few differences in oxidative status in liver and muscle when compared with rats and mice. In the present work we determinate the effect of a blood meal in the levels of liver and muscle TBARS and carbonyl protein (CP) as well as activities of antioxidant enzyme (Catalase, GST, GR and G6PDH) in vampire bat. We observed an increase in hepatic GST and G6PDH activities after 24h of blood ingestion. A tendency towards an increase in CP levels and towards a mild decrease in TBARS levels was observed in muscle. No changes (over 24h) were found in catalase, GR, CP and TBARS in liver, as well as GST and G6PDH activities in muscle. These results suggest an important role of liver GST and G6PDH to maintain redox status during blood digestion. Biological significance of CP and TBARS levels data in muscle remain unclear. Conceivably, fine regulation of iron metabolism may enable vampire bat to deal with an iron-enriched diet avoiding its availability for oxidative stress induction. Further studies on proteins involved in iron metabolism in gut (where iron intake is controlled) are now under way to confirm this hypothesis."

"Free Radical Metabolism during Diapause in the Sunflower Caterpillar (Chlosyne lacinia)","msc_project","Moreira, D.C.","University of Brasilia, Brazil","when",NA,NA,TRUE,"Animals challenged with adverse environmental conditions rely on metabolic depression is as an important adaptive response. Endogenous antioxidant defenses play important roles in different metabolic depression processes (e.g. hypoxia tolerance, freezing, hibernation, estivation and diapause). Among the situations of metabolic depression in which the redox metabolism have been addressed, diapause is one of the least studied, especially in tropical insects. The aim of this work was to identify adaptations of the redox metabolism associated to tropical diapause employing as an animal model the bordered patch Chlosyne lacinia caterpillars. The determination of antioxidant and intermediary metabolism enzymes activity and of glutathione and oxidative stress markers concentrations were conducted in whole body homogenates. Animals were collected in three different months, January and March (2010), and June (2011). Experimental groups were active animals (control), diapausing animals for 0-24 hours, 20, 40, 60 and 120 days, and post-diapause active animals. Citrate synthase (CS) activity decreased (70%) at the diapause beginning and returned to control levels at the end of diapause. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase (selenium independent) also decreased by 64%, 51% and 43% respectively at the diapause beginning and returned to control levels at the end of diapause. The activities of glutathione reductase and selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase were not detected in C. lacinia. There were significant correlations between antioxidant activities and CS activity. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase activity remained unchanged is response to diapause. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+) activity increased at diapause beginning and remained higher than control until the 40th day of diapause. Glutathione transferase (GST) activity increased in response to diapause. In the first 24 hours of diapause GST activity increased by 370%. The concentrations of glutathione equivalents (GSH-eq), reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) decreased significantly during diapause and returned to control levels after diapause. Thus, the GSSG/GSH-eq ratio was unaltered. The levels of oxidative stress markers (TBARS and protein carbonyls) either decreased or remained constant during diapause. The results indicate decreased mitochondrial density and reduced aerobic metabolism those were already related during diapause in other species. Potentially diminished production of reactive oxygen species together with mechanisms of reduced energetic demand justify the reduction of endogenous antioxidants. Diapause beginning is accompanied by an increased potential production of NADPH, which could be used by the antioxidant system, by fatty acid synthesis and by polyol synthesis – as dehydration resistance mechanism. Increased GST activity, also observed in other diapausing insects, could play roles other than xenobiotics detoxication, including the binding and transport of biomolecules. The biological function of GST during diapause must be further investigated. The lack of evidences showing oxidative stress or redox imbalance indicates that C. lacinia presents efficient biochemical adaptation to survive the metabolic transitions occurring in the tropical diapause under low humidity."

"Redox metabolism adaptations to extreme environments: mechanism, distribution and occurrence of the “Preparation for Oxidative Stress” phenomenon.","phd_project","Moreira, D.C.","University of Brasilia, Brazil","when",NA,NA,TRUE,"Evolution has selected a set of biochemical and physiological adaptations in animals that tolerate wide variations of environmental parameters. Due to its roles in energy metabolism and in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, fluctuations in O2 availability are potentially deleterious to animals. Extreme environments in which oxygen availability and consumption are strongly affected include events of hypoxia, anoxia, freezing, severe dehydration, aerial exposure of aquatic organisms, and estivation. The increase in endogenous antioxidants levels is a common strategy of animals submitted to such situations. This strategy was coined “Preparation for Oxidative Stress” (POS). The aim of this study was: (i) to propose a detailed molecular mechanism for the activation of POS under low oxygen stresses; (ii) to design classification criteria and classify species, determining the prevalence of POS in animals; and (iii) to verify the occurrence of POS in two anurans from the Caatinga during estivation in their natural environment. Published data indicates that POS could be activated by a surge in ROS production during hypoxia. According to this model, the rise in ROS generation would activate redox-sensitive transcription factors (Nrf2, FoxO, HIF-1 e NF-κB), leading to enhanced antioxidant defenses. The proportion of POS- positive species in the animal kingdom depends on the nature of the low oxygen stress. The prevalence of POS-positive species was 54-77%, 64-77% and 75-86% for aerial exposure, anoxia and freezing respectively. In the case of estivation and dehydration the prevalence was higher, reaching 91-100%. For hypoxia, the prevalence of POS-positive animals was 37.5-53%, depending on the criteria. The high prevalence of POS-positive species highlights the important role of antioxidant modulation during low oxygen stresses. Considering that results from field-collected animals might be more ecologically relevant than those from laboratory experiments, we investigated the modulation of antioxidants in the muscle of two anuran species from the Caatinga, Pleurodema diplolistris and Proceratophrys cristiceps, during estivation without experimental intervention. To do so, we measured the activities of metabolic and antioxidant enzymes, as well as the concentration of reduced and disulfide glutathione. In both species, the activity of citrate synthase decreased by 36% in the muscle of estivating animals collected in the dry season compared to active animals collected in the rainy season. The activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase (total) and glutathione peroxidase (H2O2) increased in both species during estivation. In P. diplolistris, they increased by 74%, 74% and 73% respectively. While they increased by 48%, 57% and 78% respectively in P. cristiceps. Such enhanced antioxidant capacity in both species is the first report of POS occurrence in animals estivating under natural conditions."
